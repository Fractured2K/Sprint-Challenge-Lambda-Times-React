1. PropTypes are used for Typechecking. Typechecking is a way to catch erorrs and rule out errors that you can possibly get. This is important because as
an application scales more bugs have the chance of being introduced and Typechecking can reduce the amount of possible errors.

2. When developing in React every Component follows a cycle of Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting this is called the Component life-cycle. During this cycle there are many methods available for you to use during the phases. componentDidMount is a useful life-cycle method that is called during the Mouting phase of the application. componentDidMount is only called once in this life-cycle and is typically used for setting state using data from a API call.

3. A Higher Order Component is a advanced technique in React for reusing component logic amongst passed in Components.

4. Three possible ways of styling in react include Vanilla CSS, CSS Preprocessors, and Styled Components. Vanillia CSS is good to right out of the box and needs no additional setup making it super easy to work with. CSS Preprocessors are great because they extend vanilla css with much more functionality while also being very modular. Styled components or JS in CSS are great for componentizing styles allowing you to import them into React components as needed. Another good use for Styled Components is when working with CSS Frameworks. Styled Components makes it much easier to style while working with certain Frameworks.
